## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Project: Diagnosing Malaria using Microscopic Images of Red Blood Cells
- Successfully developed a deep learning machine algorithm able to accurately classify images of red blood cells to diagnose malaria with 98.65% accuracy. 
- [Performed exploratory data analyses, and applied RGB to HSV and Gaussian blurring pre-processing techniques](https://gist.github.com/JuliaDale/1f902fc1521d66d49c9748f515ddeb30)
- [Created various CNNs with differing architectures, and applied transfer learning in order to classify images into two categories: parasitized cells and uninfected cells](https://gist.github.com/JuliaDale/b683941da8ba76410fc429279862965c)
- [Explored contrast stretching and histogram equalization pre-processing techniques in order to optimize performance of the models](https://gist.github.com/JuliaDale/12cd1fff7cdd485c6188551ca13b7329)
- [Created a presentation sharing my findings and results](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H-fjJ4YdpcWvZLbXw5StWorAfqCtIv2NZVShaGRXMSo/edit?usp=sharing)

## [Recommendation Systems Project: Amazon Product Recommendation](https://gist.github.com/JuliaDale/f37a20465c8f38872733ee28a9b9445f)
- Created both user-user and item-item based collaborative filtering with KNN clusterings. 
- Built a recommendation system using matrix factorization, specifically single value decomposition (SVD). 

## [Decision Tree and Random Forest Project: Predicting Potential Customers of an EdTech Company](https://gist.github.com/JuliaDale/10fbb34e1494488f4eecb99f93ec452e)
- Created a decision tree model and random forest classifier to help a company identify customers that are most likely to convert

## [Regression Project: Boston Housing Price Prediction](https://gist.github.com/JuliaDale/a7ab9e3f29d15d71f4c2b83ad5796afa)
- Performed exploratory data analyses, including univariate and bivariate analyses
- Removed multicollinearity and insignificant features
- Created a linear regression model able to predict house prices in Boston based on multiple factors

## [Classification Project: Predicting Hotel Cancellations](https://gist.github.com/JuliaDale/7b29f8efc76ba6b3b8b4b524430cffb7)
- Created a logistic regression model and K- nearest neighbor (K-NN) model in order to determine which guests are likely to cancel their reservation based on a variety of factors

## [Unsupervised Learning Project: Segmenting Banking Customers](https://gist.github.com/JuliaDale/d94fb1c34f28d4216a6f1aa6fbbf2038) 
- Applied K- means clustering, Gaussian mixture model, and K- medoids clustering to identify three different groups of banking customers based on their spending patterns and bank interactions 

## [Time Series Project: Forecasting Amazon Stock Prices](https://gist.github.com/JuliaDale/bb02ec816a549b4c0abdbbd15e3aa84b)
- Decomposed the time series components into trend, seasonality and residual 
- Created AR, MA, ARMA, and ARIMA models in order to forecast Amazon stock prices

## [Artificial Neural Network](https://gist.github.com/JuliaDale/ac74e456ca020559aab737655f2b680e) and [Convolutional Neural Network](https://gist.github.com/JuliaDale/8f4e9263dc23bee33399503babe8a700) Projects: Digit Recognition of Street View Housing Numbers
- Created an ANN and CNN able to identify digits with 80% and 90% accuracy respectively

## [PCA and t-SNE Project: Identifying Vehicle Types](https://gist.github.com/JuliaDale/93a8944770925d45d7c216c8365a214a)
- Applied PCA and t-SNE in order to reduce dimensionality and group various types of vehicles
