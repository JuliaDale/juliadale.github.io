# Julia Freed Portfolio

## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Project: Diagnosing Malaria using Microscopic Images of Red Blood Cells
- [Performed exploratory data analyses, and applied RGB to HSV and Gaussian blurring pre-processing techniques](https://gist.github.com/JuliaDale/1f902fc1521d66d49c9748f515ddeb30)
- [Created various CNNs with differing architectures, and applied transfer learning in order to classify images into two categories: parasitized cells and uninfected cells](https://gist.github.com/JuliaDale/b683941da8ba76410fc429279862965c)
- [Explored contrast stretching and histogram equalization pre-processing techniques in order to optimize performance of the models](https://gist.github.com/JuliaDale/12cd1fff7cdd485c6188551ca13b7329)

## [Regression Project: Boston Housing Price Prediction](file:///Users/ryanburwell/Downloads/Learners_Notebook_Boston_house_price.html)
- Performed exploratory data analyses, including univariate and bivariate analyses
- Removed multicollinearity and insignificant features
- Created a linear regression model able to predict house prices in Boston based on multiple factors

## [Unsupervised Learning Project: Segmenting Banking Customers](file:///Users/ryanburwell/Downloads/Learner_Notebook_Unsupervised_Learning_Project.html) 
- Applied K- means clustering, Gaussian mixture model, and K- medoids clustering to identify three different groups of banking customers based on their spending patterns and bank interactions 

## [PCA and t-SNE Project: Identifying Vehicle Types](file:///Users/ryanburwell/Downloads/Learner_Notebook_PCA_and_tSNE_Project.html)
- Applied PCA and t-SNE in order to reduce dimensionality and group various types of vehicles

## [Classification Project: Predicting Hotel Cancellations](file:///Users/ryanburwell/Downloads/Learner_Notebook_Project_Classification_ML.html)
- Created a logistic regression model and K- nearest neighbor (K-NN) model in order to determine which guests are likely to cancel their reservation based on a variety of factors

## [Time Series Project: Forecasting Amazon Stock Prices](file:///Users/ryanburwell/Downloads/Julia_Freed_Time_Series.html)
- Decomposed the time series components into trend, seasonality and residual 
- Created AR, MA, ARMA, and ARIMA models in order to forecast Amazon stock prices

## [Decision Tree and Random Forest Project: Predicting Potential Customers of an EdTech Company](file:///Users/ryanburwell/Downloads/Julia_Freed_Classification_PDS.html)
- Created a decision tree model and random forest classifier to help a company identify customers that are most likely to convert

## [Artificial Neural Network](file:///Users/ryanburwell/Downloads/Julia_Freed_ANN.html) and [Convolutional Neural Network](file:///Users/ryanburwell/Downloads/Julia_Freed_CNN.html) Projects: Digit Recognition of Street View Housing Numbers
- Created an ANN and CNN able to identify digits with 80% and 90% accuracy respectively
